title: About Me
---

I enjoy solving problems. This is what has inspired me to work in computing as systems technicians and is also what has pushed me to study computer science to become a developer. I have spent the past year learning to build applications using technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React, among others. While I am primarily familiar with Node.js, I am willing and interested to learn other technologies for future projects.
