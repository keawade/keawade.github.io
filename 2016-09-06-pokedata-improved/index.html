<h1>PokéData Improved</h1>
<p class="date">September 06, 2016</p>
<p><p>I took another look at the <a href="https://keawade.github.io/pokedata-old">PokeData</a> app, this time with an eye towards what technologies would work best rather than trying to cram some odd things in for the development experience. What I've come up with is <a href="https://keawade.github.io/pokedata">a new version of PokeData</a> built using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> without <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> or <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI</a>.</p>

<p>Removing Redux was an easy choice for this app since it wasn't necessary in the slightest and just complicated the app for no reason. The <a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/FAQ.html#when-should-i-use-redux">Redux FAQ answer to &quot;When should I use Redux?&quot;</a>, while slightly cryptic, is a good one.</p>
<p>No longer using PokeAPI was mildly annoying as I had to build the data I was using from it into my app directly but dramatically improved performance. While PokeAPI has a ton of data, it isn't presented in a particulary useful structure and suffers from extremely slow access speeds. I can't complain too much since it is a free service, but it was responsible for the only noticeable latency resulting in load times of <em>five to ten seconds</em>.</p>
<p>Overall, the app is much more responsive and the code is much cleaner. <a href="https://keawade.github.io/pokedata">The app is available here.</a> As always, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/keawade/pokedata/issues">report bugs or request features</a>.</p>
