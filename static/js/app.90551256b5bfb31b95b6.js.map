This is done with a tiered infrastructure of timing devices.\\n\\nThe top tier, stratum zero, consists of high precision time devices like [atomic clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock) or [global positioning system clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_clock#GPS_clocks) that keep extremely precise time. Below this tier is stratum one which consists of servers with their system clocks closely synchronized with an attached stratum zero device. Next are the stratum two servers with synchronization to stratum one servers and so on.\\n\\nTo avoid overloading stratum one servers with time requests from clients most stratum one servers are not available for public time requests. Instead, many stratum two servers are maintained specifically for the purpose of providing time synchronization to any client machine. These servers are often managed by businesses for their internal networks but many are managed by organizations like universities or the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for general use.\\n\\nThe rest of this article will explain how to implement your own time server and configure it.\\n\\n## Planning\\n\\nWe need to choose public servers to synchronize with. There are several lists we can choose upstream servers from.\\n\\n* [NTP.org](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome#Browsing_the_Lists)\\n* [NTP Pool Project](http://www.pool.ntp.org/)\\n* [NIST Internet Time Servers](http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi)\\n\\nThere are [a few things](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers#Section_5.3.1.) to keep in mind when selecting your upstream servers.\\n\\n1. Do not use any time servers which you do not have permission to use! The severs you select should be:\\n  * Public time servers made available by your service provider or OS vendor to their customers\\n  * And/or, other private time servers for which you have been given explicit permission and instructions on proper use\\n  * And/or, the time servers designated by the pool.ntp.org project\\n  * And/or, on one of the public lists of time servers\\n2. Make sure your selected servers are diverse and not maintained by or synchronized with the same organizations.\\n3. Make sure your selected servers are moderately close to your network location. This is not super critical, but try to avoid servers half way around the world.\\n\\nThere may be other things specific to your implementation, but this will give you a good start. For more information, check out the [official NTP guidelines](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers#Section_5.3.1.) for server selection.\\n\\nIt is [recommended](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers#Section_5.3.3.) that you choose at least five upstream servers to allow your system to protect against up to two *falsetickers*, servers that are not reporting the correct time. Depending on your needs, you may want to consider using more.\\n\\nFor this guide, I've selected seven stratum one servers from around the United States to create a stratum two server for my network. When I selected my servers, I took care to only pick servers that are **OpenAccess** and did not require **NotificationMessage**. Be careful when selecting your own servers as many require a NotificationMessage but neglected to change their policy to RestrictedAccess as [specifically requested](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NotificationMessage) by ntp.org (Grumble, grumble).\\n\\n* [ntp.your.org](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000498)\\n* [time-b.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000280)\\n* [rackety.udel.edu](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000290)\\n* [clock.fmt.he.net](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000011)\\n* [gpstime.la-archdiocese.net](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000787)\\n* [nist1.columbiacountyga.gov](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000378)\\n* [gclock02.dupa01.burst.net](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000974)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThis guide will work with NTP on CentOS. Other Linux distributions will have slight differences but should not be to difficult to configure using this guide.\\nFirst, install the Network Time Protocol.\\n\\n`yum install ntp -y`\\n\\nYou will likely want NTP to start on boot. CentOS 7 uses SystemD to manage services. Use the following command to enable starting on boot.\\n\\n`systemctl enable ntpd`\\n\\nIf you are running an older version of CentOS you will need to use chkconfig to do this.\\n\\n`chkconfig ntpd on`\\n\\nNow our NTP service will run every time the server boots. At this point we're ready to start configuring the server. We won't start the service yet, we'll wait until we have a basic configuration to test first.\\n\\n## Server Configuration\\n\\nNow that you have selected your upstream servers and have installed NTP on your own server, you are ready to start configuring NTP to synchronize. We will first make a backup of your original NTP configuration file so we can look through it later. For now though we will delete the original (But not the backup!), and then create our own config file to work with.\\n\\n`cp /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp.conf.bak`\\n\\n`rm /etc/ntp.conf`\\n\\n`nano /etc/ntp.conf`\\n\\nIf you want to return to the original file, just replace the actual file with your backup to start over by running the following command.\\n\\n`cp /etc/ntp.conf.bak /etc/ntp.conf`\\n\\nHere is an example ntp.conf file that I'll be using to explain the basic concepts of the configuration.\\n\\n    # Drift file.\\n    driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift\\n    # Permit\\n    restrict default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    restrict -6 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    # Servers\\n    server ntp.your.org iburst\\n    server time-b.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov iburst\\n    server rackety.udel.edu iburst\\n    server clock.fmt.he.net iburst\\n    server gpstime.la-archdiocese.net iburst\\n    server nist1.columbiacountyga.gov iburst\\n    server gclock02.dupa01.burst.net iburst\\n    disable monitor\\n\\nNow lets break down each of these pieces and figure out what they do.\\nFirst, the **drift file**. The drift file stores information about your system clock's drift tendency. Most system clocks keep time reasonably well but still require synchronization in order to remain accurate. The drift file keeps track of how much your system clock tends to drift from actual time. Then, if you lose your connection to your synchronization servers, it can correct itself based on the drift data it has collected. This give you a bit of slack to work with if your connections ever go down.\\n\\nThe **restrict** lines restricts what external machines can do to our server. The **server **lines define the addresses we will attempt to synchronize with. First we declare the server name and then add the **iburst** parameter. The [iburst parameter](http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.1/confopt.htm) has the service send a burst of eight packets instead of only one when the server is unreachable to help speed up the time to acquire a connection.\\n\\nThe **disable monitor** line [fixes a vulnerability](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#DRDoS_Amplification_Attack_using) from January 2014 on older versions of NTP.\\n\\nWe can now save our config file and start the service!\\n\\n`systemctl start ntpd`\\n\\nor\\n\\n`service ntpd start`\\n\\nNow that the NTP service is running, we need to make sure our firewall is configured to allow incoming NTP traffic so our clients can synchronize with our server.\\n\\n`firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp`\\n\\n`systemctl restart firewalld`\\n\\nor\\n\\n`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT`\\n\\n`/sbin/service iptables save`\\n\\n`service iptables restart`\\n\\nOnce the server is running we can use the command `ntpq -p` to list our servers and view details about our connections to them. We can also use `ntpstat` to see our current synchronization status. For details on what this data means, check the [NTP documentation page for the ntpq command](http://doc.ntp.org/4.2.4/ntpq.html).\\n\\n## Client Configuration\\n\\nThe client configuration is much simpler than the server configuration was. First, repeat the installation steps for the NTP service. Next, repeat the configuration steps but when you create your new ntp.conf file we will do some things differently.\\n\\n    # Drift file.\\n    driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift\\n    # Permit\\n    restrict default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    restrict -6 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    # Servers\\n    server time.mydomain.com iburst\\n\\nSince our source is known, and likely internal, we can get away with a bit less security. Also, since we don't need anything to connect to the clients on an incoming port, we don't need to modify our firewall rules as long as outgoing traffic is unrestricted (As it is by default).\\nFinally, use the `ntpq -p` and `ntpstat` commands to verify your NTP service is synchronizing with your server.\\n\\nCongratulations! You have just finished configuring your basic NTP server and clients! There are several more things we could do to improve security and redundancy but this is where this particular guide will end.\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 192:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"Hyper-V can be a particularly useful tool for consolidating computing resources. However, while consolidating machines into VMs can lower your hardware overhead costs, this introduces a single failure point for all your machines. If the Hyper-V server goes down, all your VMs will go down as well.\\n\\nTo overcome this issue, we can use Hyper-V's Failover and Load-balancing tools to build a Hyper-V cluster. These tools will provide failover for our machines so that, in the event of a critical failure on one of our Hyper-V nodes, the VMs running on that node will come back up on another node within seconds.\\n\\n## Install OS\\n\\nBegin by installing Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter on each of your nodes.\\n\\n>If you are not planning on creating more than two Server 2012 Standard virtual machines, you can use Server 2012 Standard edition. However, if you need more Server 2012 Standard instances or if you need Server 2012 Datacenter instances, you will need to use Server 2012 Datacenter for your cluster nodes.\\n\\n> This is because of the way Microsoft handles their server licenses [(More details)](http://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/virtual-machine-licensing-hyper-v/).\\n\\nWe don't need anything fancy here. Just install the OS normally and apply all updates.\\n\\n## Network Overview\\n\\nAt a minimum, we need three separate networks: Data, Heartbeat, and iSCSI. The Data network will handle client connections and Internet connectivity. The Heartbeat network is an internal network exclusive to the cluster used for Live Migrations of virtual machines and cluster communications between nodes. The iSCSI network connects each of our nodes to our remote storage device.\\n\\n>For the purposes of this guide, the remote storage will be located on a [NimbleStorage](http://www.nimblestorage.com/products-technology/products-specs/) SAN. Nimble recommends using Multipath I/O instead of network teaming for their iSCSI connections so that is what this guide will be doing. Check with your remote storage manufacturer and use their recommended best practices.\\n\\n## Configure Network Connections\\n\\nFor this example, each of our cluster nodes has six Network Interface Cards (NICs) to provide redundancy for each network connection. We are going to use the NIC Teaming manager to manage our Load Balancing and Failover (LBFO) for\\nour duplicate NICs.\\n\\n> The NIC Teaming manager can be opened by running *lbfoadmin* from the Start menu or by clicking the link next to NIC Teaming in *Server Manager > Local Server*.\\n\\nLets team our Data and Heartbeat connections. Our iSCSI connections will use Multipath I/O instead. [Instructions NIC teaming can be found here.](/2015/07/06/Load_Balancing_and_Failover_on_Server_2012/)\\n\\n>The six NICs on my servers are in three pairs of two NICs each. To increase redundancy, I split my teams across the pairs so if any one pair were to go down, the other two would be able to handle the traffic until the first pair\\ncould be replaced.\\n\\nNow that our teams have been created, we need to configure the addresses of each connection. The following table shows an example configuration. Note that the Data, Heartbeat, and iSCSI networks are on separate subnets. Modify this as\\nnecessary for your own network environment.\\n\\n|           | NICs | Node1        | Node2        | Node3        | Subnet |\\n|-----------|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|\\n| Data      | 1, 6 | 192.168.0.11 | 192.168.0.12 | 192.168.0.13 | /24    |\\n| Heartbeat | 2, 3 | 192.168.1.11 | 192.168.1.12 | 192.168.1.13 | /24    |\\n| iSCSI     | 4    | 192.168.2.11 | 192.168.2.12 | 192.168.2.13 | /24    |\\n| iSCSI     | 5    | 192.168.2.21 | 192.168.2.22 | 192.168.2.23 | /24    |\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\nEnable Remote Desktop connections to each of your nodes so we can manage them more easily later. We also need to add each node to our domain. If your remote storage solution uses Multipath I/O, install that now using this [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852172.aspx):\\n\\n`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature –Online –FeatureName MultiPathIO`\\n\\n>If you are using a NimbleStorage SAN, you should install their Nimble Connection utility now. Be sure to select the deselected option when prompted for components to install.\\n\\n>I don't think the nodes _must_ be members of a domain but it does make several steps in the install simpler.\\n\\n## Install Hyper-V\\nTo install the Hyper-V service, run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205467%28v=wps.630%29.aspx) on each node:\\n\\n`Install-WindowsFeature –Name Hyper-V -IncludeManagementTools -Restart`\\n\\n> This command will install the Hyper-V service with its management tools and then restart the server.\\n\\n## Configure Virtual Switch\\n\\nWe need to create our Hyper-V Virtual Switches. For a smooth cluster installation, make sure each of these switches is identical on each node. A way to do this without much hassle is to run the same [PowerShell commands](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848455%28v=wps.630%29.aspx) on each node instead of manually configuring each switch. Run the following command on each node. If you are accessing your node via RDP your connection will be interrupted for a few seconds.\\n\\n`New-VMSwitch “Data” –NetAdapterName “Data” –AllowManagementOS:$true`\\n\\n>This command will create a new virtual switch named Data that is connected to the network adapter on your server node named Data. It will create a new virtual NIC on your node called vData that your local node will use since\\nthe physical NIC is now tied directly to the virtual switch.\\n\\n## Install Failover Clustering\\n\\nWe are nearly ready to cluster our node servers! On each node, run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205467%28v=wps.630%29.aspx) to install the Failover Clustering service with its management tools:\\n\\n`Install-WindowsFeature –Name Failover-Clustering –IncludeManagementTools`\\n\\nBefore we actually cluster our nodes, let's test our configuration. Run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee461026.aspx) and check the report for any failures.\\n\\n`Test-Cluster –Node Node1,Node2,Node3 -ReportName \\\"C:\\\\TestClusterReport\\\"`\\n\\n>You are likely to get warnings concerning your cluster's storage. This is fine. We will configure the cluster's shared storage soon.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the report and addressing any problems, we are ready to cluster our nodes! Run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee460973.aspx) to create the cluster:\\n\\n`New-Cluster –Name Cluster1 –Node Node1,Node2,Node3 –StaticAddress 192.168.0.10`\\n\\n## Configure Cluster Shared Volumes\\n\\nAt this point, you should refer to your remote storage manufacturer's best practice documentation for Hyper-V to configure your Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV).\\n\\n>I will describe the steps necessary for a NimbleStorage SAN. If you are using a different remote storage system, you can skip most of this section and refer to your manufacturer's documentation instead.\\n\\n>I will describe the steps necessary to connect to an existing volume but not how to create that volume on the SAN. Please refer to [their documentation](https://infosight.nimblestorage.com/InfoSight/login) instead.\\n\\nOn each node, open the Nimble Connection Manager and exclude all addresses except the iSCSI addresses. Make sure each node's Initiator Name is added to the SAN's initiator group. Enter your Nimble's Discovery IP and switch to the Nimble Volumes tab. Select the desired volume and click connect.\\n\\nOn only one of your nodes, open Disk Management and bring the new disk online. Initialize the disk and format with NTFS. You do not need to select a drive letter. In the Failover Cluster Manager, right click on Disks and select Add Disk. Select the available disks you want to add to the cluster's shared storage and click OK.

I'll be posting more of my solutions as I have time to write up my methodologies (and complete some of them).\\n\\nThe first set of puzzles involves Santa navigating an infinite high-rise building with and infinite basement. Santa is given instructions in the form of a string of parentheses which tell him to go up or down one floor.\\n\\n# Part 1\\n\\n## Problem\\n\\n>Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.\\n>\\n>An opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.\\n>\\n>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.\\n\\n## Methodology\\nBoth of these solutions follow the same basic formula. First, I read in the input that I've saved in `source/day1source.txt` and assign it to a variable. Next, I create a variable to hold the value of the current floor. I then use a loop to loop through each character in the string. For each character I check if the instruction is to go up one floor and if it is, I increment the `floor` variable by 1, otherwise I decrement the `floor` variable by 1. When the loop completes going through all the characters, I print out the final `floor` variable value.\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Node.js\\n```js\\nvar fs = require('fs')\\n\\nvar source = fs.readFileSync('../source/day1source.txt').toString()\\nvar end = source.length\\nvar floor = 1\\nfor (var i = 0; i < end; i++) {\\n  if (source.charAt(i) === '(') {\\n    floor++\\n  } else {\\n    floor--\\n  }\\n}\\nconsole.log('Santa ends up on floor ' + floor)\\n```\\n\\n### Python\\n```python\\nfilename = '../source/day1source.txt'\\n\\nwith open(filename) as f:\\n    source = [line.rstrip('\\\\n') for line in open(filename)]\\n\\nfloor = 0\\n\\nfor line in source:\\n    for char in line:\\n        if char == '(':\\n            floor = floor + 1\\n        else:\\n            floor = floor - 1\\n\\nprint \\\"Santa ends up on floor\\\", floor\\n```\\n\\n# Part 2\\n\\n## Problem\\n>Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor `-1`). The first character in the instructions has position `1`, the second character has position `2`, and so on.\\n\\n## Methodology\\nTo solve this, I modified my code to detect when the `floor` variable equals `-1` and prints out the current position in the string.\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Node.js\\n```js\\nvar fs = require('fs')\\n\\nvar source = fs.readFileSync('../source/day1source.txt').toString()\\nvar end = source.length\\nvar floor = 1\\nfor (var i = 0; i < end; i++) {\\n  if (source.charAt(i) === '(') {\\n    floor++\\n  } else {\\n    floor--\\n  }\\n  if (floor === -1) {\\n    console.log('The character ' + source.charAt(i) + ' at position ' + i + ' sent santa to the basement.')\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Python\\n```python\\nfilename = '../source/day1source.txt'\\n\\nwith open(filename) as f:\\n    source = [line.rstrip('\\\\n') for line in open(filename)]\\n\\nfloor = 0\\ncount = 0\\n\\nfor line in source:\\n    for char in line:\\n        if char == '(':\\n            floor = floor + 1\\n        else:\\n            floor = floor - 1\\n        count = count + 1\\n        if floor == -1:\\n            print \\\"Santa enters the basement on instruction\\\", count\\n            break\\n```\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 194:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"The elves have run out of wrapping paper and ribbon! For this puzzle we are given the dimensions of a bunch of presents as a list of strings and are asked to compute how much wrapping paper and ribbon should be ordered to wrap the remaining presents.\\n\\nGet your own puzzle input and record your progress over at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)!\\n\\n## Problem 1\\n\\n>The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.\\n>\\n>Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect [right rectangular prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid)), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l`. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.\\n>\\n>All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total **square feet of wrapping paper** should they order?\\n\\n## Methodology\\nI handled the solutions for Node and Python slightly differently because of syntatic differences. Despite these slight changes, the general approach is still the same. I will describe my methodology in terms of the Node.js code.\\n\\nFirst, I read in the source from `source/day2source.txt` and `split()` the string on the new line character, `\\\\n`. I assign this output to the variable `source`. This variable is an array with each element of that array containing the string from each line of the original file.\\n\\nNext, I create the variable `total` to store the running total of how much wrapping paper we need.\\n\\nNow that I have my `source` variable and `total` counter, I loop through the array elements of `source`. On each iteration I split the substring in the array element on the character `x`, find the three side sizes, assign them to temporary variables (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`), and then find the smallest of the six sides and store it in the temporary variable `smallest`.\\n\\nFinally, I add up the dimensions using the given formula and add `smallest` as asked. I then add this value to the current value of `total`. After iterating through all the array elements, I print out the final value of `total`.\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Node.js\\n\\n```js\\nvar fs = require('fs')\\n\\nvar source = fs.readFileSync('../source/day2source.txt').toString().split('\\\\n')\\nvar total = 0\\nfor (var i = 0; i < source.length - 1; i++) {\\n  var tempDim = source[i].split('x')\\n  var s1 = Number(tempDim[0]) * Number(tempDim[1])\\n  var s2 = Number(tempDim[2]) * Number(tempDim[1])\\n  var s3 = Number(tempDim[0]) * Number(tempDim[2])\\n\\n  var smallest = 0\\n\\n  if (s1 > s2) {\\n    if (s2 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s2\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    if (s1 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s1\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  total = total + (2 * s1 + 2 * s2 + 2 * s3 + smallest)\\n}\\n\\nconsole.log('The elves need to order ' + total + ' square feet of wrapping paper.')\\n```\\n\\n### Python\\n\\n```python\\nfilename = '../source/day2source.txt'\\n\\nwith open(filename) as f:\\n    source = [line.rstrip('\\\\n') for line in open(filename)]\\n\\ntotal = 0\\n\\nfor line in source:\\n    temp = line.split('x')\\n    s1 = int(temp[0]) * int(temp[1])\\n    s2 = int(temp[2]) * int(temp[1])\\n    s3 = int(temp[0]) * int(temp[2])\\n\\n    if s1 > s2:\\n        if s2 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s2\\n    else:\\n        if s1 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s1\\n    total = total + (2*s1 + 2* s2 + 2*s3 + smallest)\\n\\nprint \\\"The elves need to order\\\", total, \\\"square feet of wrapping paper\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Problem 2\\n>The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so they only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they would again like to be exact.\\n>\\n>The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one face. Each present also requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for the perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.\\n>\\n>How many total **feet of ribbon** should they order?\\n\\n## Methodology\\nThis time I need to compare the widths of the packages instead of their face areas. I also need to find the two smallest widths rather than just the smallest. Finally, instead of finding surface area, I need to find a length of ribbon using the given formula.\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Node.js\\n\\n```js\\nvar fs = require('fs')\\n\\nvar source = fs.readFileSync('../source/day2source.txt').toString().split('\\\\n')\\nvar total = 0\\nfor (var i = 0; i < source.length - 1; i++) {\\n  var tempDim = source[i].split('x')\\n  var s1 = Number(tempDim[0])\\n  var s2 = Number(tempDim[1])\\n  var s3 = Number(tempDim[2])\\n\\n  var smallest = 0\\n  var nextSmallest = 0\\n\\n  if (s1 > s2) {\\n    if (s2 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n      nextSmallest = s2\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s2\\n      if (s1 > s3) {\\n        nextSmallest = s3\\n      } else {\\n        nextSmallest = s1\\n      }\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    if (s1 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n      nextSmallest = s1\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s1\\n      if (s2 > s3) {\\n        nextSmallest = s3\\n      } else {\\n        nextSmallest = s2\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  total = total + (smallest * 2) + (nextSmallest * 2) + (s1 * s2 * s3)\\n}\\n\\nconsole.log('The elves need to order ' + total + ' feet of ribbon.')\\n```\\n\\n### Python\\n\\n```python\\nfilename = '../source/day2source.txt'\\n\\nwith open(filename) as f:\\n    source = [line.rstrip('\\\\n') for line in open(filename)]\\n\\ntotal = 0\\n\\nfor line in source:\\n    temp = line.split('x')\\n    s1 = int(temp[0])\\n    s2 = int(temp[1])\\n    s3 = int(temp[2])\\n\\n    if s1 > s2:\\n        if s2 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n            nextSmallest = s2\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s2\\n            if s1 > s3:\\n                nextSmallest = s3\\n            else:\\n                nextSmallest = s1\\n    else:\\n        if s1 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n            nextSmallest = s1\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s1\\n            if s2 > s3:\\n                nextSmallest = s3\\n            else:\\n                nextSmallest = s2\\n\\n    total = total + smallest*2 + nextSmallest*2 + s1*s2*s3\\n\\nprint \\\"The elves need to order\\\", total, \\\"square feet of wrapping paper\\\"\\n```\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 195:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"Last fall I had a bit of fun building a calculator app, [cuddly-weasel](/cuddly-weasel/), using only DOM manipulation and CSS. I thought I would take some time here to highlight some of the more interesting things I ran into in the course of this project.\\n\\nThe [Data Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), or DOM, is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The DOM provides a way to store a HTML or XML document in an object-oriented representation that can be manipulated with a scripting language like JavaScript.\\n\\nWhile [DOM manipulation](https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website/topics/jquery-dom-manipulation/jquery-dom) is useful, it generally isn't recommended to do your entire front end with DOM manipulation as it is much simpler to build the outline in HTML or a templating engine like ~~[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)~~ *Edit: Jade has been renamed to [Pug](http://pugjs.org/)* or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and then modify that existing code. However, it is possible to generate a page using very little markup and building the page with DOM manipulation and this is exactly what I did for this project.\\n\\n# Cuddly Weasel\\n\\nThe complete [app is available here](/cuddly-weasel/) and the [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/keawade/cuddly-weasel). The rest of this article will highlight some of the more interesting implementations and manipulations in the application.\\n\\n## Name\\n\\nThis project was one of the first projects that I used GitHub's built in project name generator for. I knew what I was building but didn't care for the dull name of just \\\"Calculator\\\" so I cycled through several names until settling upon `cuddly-weasel`. If I were building this app for anything other than my own personal use and practice, I would probably need to put in more effort. As it stands, though, I just need a unique name for my project and this one is a fun one.\\n\\n[![Rendered app](http://image.thum.io/get/width/800/crop/700/http://keawade.io/cuddly-weasel)](/cuddly-weasel/)\\n\\n## Design Considerations\\n\\nLike the name, the visual design for this project is arbitrary. I didn't have any real goal in mind with this design, I just built some elements and then started throwing CSS at it to see what stuck.\\n\\n### Colors and Font\\n\\nI went with the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette for simplicity. It allowed me to have a solid palette without having to make it up as I worked. The theme toggle was built for fun since Solarized already had a light theme with colors that directly correspond to each other. All I needed was an alternate set of colors in the CSS and it was done.\\n\\nFor the font I used [Inconsolata](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata) from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). I chose this font was because I wanted a monospace font and I also wanted to make sure that all users would see the same font and have the same experience.\\n\\n### Layout\\n\\nOriginally, I only had the top four rows of buttons with the core mechanics for the calculator which mirrored simple calculators one might find at a Walmart. As I kept adding more buttons, I never made any big changes to the design and just let [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) continue my original layout with the new buttons.\\n\\n## Code\\n\\nMy app is an interface that uses the [mathjs](http://mathjs.org/) library to do all the actual calculations. This means that users can use mathjs features that I haven't implemented buttons for by manually typing the [expressions](http://mathjs.org/docs/index.html) into the input box.\\n\\n### Buttons\\n\\nEach button element has an event listener listening for a click event. When that event occurs, it calls the `handleButton(event)` function.\\n\\n```js\\nfunction handleButton(event) {\\n  var box = document.getElementById('cal-box');\\n\\n  if (!(box === document.activeElement)) {\\n    // Solve\\n    if(autoclear){\\n      if(lastNum == '=') {\\n        box.value = '';\\n      }\\n    }\\n    if (event.target.id == '=') {\\n      var temp = box.value.replace(/ln\\\\(/g, 'log(');\\n      answer = math.eval(temp);\\n      if (!isNaN(answer)) {\\n        box.value = answer;\\n        if(autoclear){\\n          lastNum = '=';\\n        } else {\\n          lastNum = answer;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    // Clear\\n    } else if (event.target.id == 'clr') {\\n      box.value = '';\\n      lastNum = 'new';\\n    // Backspace\\n    } else if (event.target.id == '<-') {\\n      box.value = box.value.substring(0, box.value.length - 1);\\n      lastNum = box.value.charAt(box.value.length - 1);\\n    // Numbers\\n    } else if (/[0-9]/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      box.value = box.value + event.target.id;\\n      lastNum = event.target.id;\\n    // Symbols\\n    } else if (/[-/*+.]/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      if(!(/new|[-/*+.]/.test(lastNum))){\\n        box.value = box.value + event.target.id;\\n        lastNum = event.target.id;\\n      }\\n    } else if (event.target.id == '^'){\\n      if (/[0-9]|\\\\)/.test(lastNum)) {\\n        box.value = box.value + '^(';\\n      }\\n    } else if (/[\\\\(\\\\)]/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      box.value = box.value + event.target.id;\\n      lastNum = event.target.id;\\n    // Trig Functions\\n    } else if (/sin|cos|tan|cot|sqrt|e\\\\^|ln/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      box.value = box.value + event.target.id + '('\\n      lastNum = '(';\\n    } else if (/pi/.test(event.target.id)){\\n      box.value = box.value + '(pi)';\\n      lastNum = ')';\\n    }\\n    this.blur();\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, my code uses a line of else-if statements combined with some simple [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to quickly run through the potential inputs from the button's click event.\\n\\nThe code also keeps track of what the last character was to determine whether or not the current key press is valid. For example, if the partial expression `1+1-` has been entered, the app will not allow a key press event to enter an operator since the last character was also an operator.\\n\\nAt the end of the list of possible inputs, I've called `this.blur()` to remove focus on the clicked element caused by the default click event. This way, if the user presses their return key, it won't just trigger this click again but will only trigger the keypress event as it is supposed too.\\n\\n### Keyboard Input\\n\\nThe keyboard input was interesting. I started by implementing an event listener to listen for keypress events and evaluate them.\\n\\n```js\\ndocument.addEventListener('keypress', function(key) {\\n  var keyString = String.fromCharCode(key.charCode);\\n  if (key.keyCode == 13) {\\n    document.getElementById('=').click();\\n  } else if (/[0-9]|[-/*+=.^()]/.test(keyString)) {\\n    document.getElementById(keyString).click();\\n  } else if (key.keyCode == 8) {\\n    var box = document.getElementById('cal-box')\\n    if (box === document.activeElement) {\\n      //\\n    } else {\\n      if (box.value == '') {\\n        // Do nothing\\n      } else {\\n        document.getElementById('<-').click();\\n      }\\n    }\\n  } // keyCode 46 is Delete\\n}, false);\\n```\\n\\nHere, the listener waits for a keypress and then does a quick set of evaluations. First, it checks if the keypress is a \\n\\n[Keypress event details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keypress)\\n\\nFunctions, functions, functions.\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n\n/***/ 196:\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"**Update:** I have recently rebuilt this app without Redux or PokeAPI.

This is done with a tiered infrastructure of timing devices.\\n\\nThe top tier, stratum zero, consists of high precision time devices like [atomic clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock) or [global positioning system clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_clock#GPS_clocks) that keep extremely precise time. Below this tier is stratum one which consists of servers with their system clocks closely synchronized with an attached stratum zero device. Next are the stratum two servers with synchronization to stratum one servers and so on.\\n\\nTo avoid overloading stratum one servers with time requests from clients most stratum one servers are not available for public time requests. Instead, many stratum two servers are maintained specifically for the purpose of providing time synchronization to any client machine. These servers are often managed by businesses for their internal networks but many are managed by organizations like universities or the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for general use.\\n\\nThe rest of this article will explain how to implement your own time server and configure it.\\n\\n## Planning\\n\\nWe need to choose public servers to synchronize with. There are several lists we can choose upstream servers from.\\n\\n* [NTP.org](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome#Browsing_the_Lists)\\n* [NTP Pool Project](http://www.pool.ntp.org/)\\n* [NIST Internet Time Servers](http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi)\\n\\nThere are [a few things](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers#Section_5.3.1.) to keep in mind when selecting your upstream servers.\\n\\n1. Do not use any time servers which you do not have permission to use! The severs you select should be:\\n  * Public time servers made available by your service provider or OS vendor to their customers\\n  * And/or, other private time servers for which you have been given explicit permission and instructions on proper use\\n  * And/or, the time servers designated by the pool.ntp.org project\\n  * And/or, on one of the public lists of time servers\\n2. Make sure your selected servers are diverse and not maintained by or synchronized with the same organizations.\\n3. Make sure your selected servers are moderately close to your network location. This is not super critical, but try to avoid servers half way around the world.\\n\\nThere may be other things specific to your implementation, but this will give you a good start. For more information, check out the [official NTP guidelines](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers#Section_5.3.1.) for server selection.\\n\\nIt is [recommended](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/SelectingOffsiteNTPServers#Section_5.3.3.) that you choose at least five upstream servers to allow your system to protect against up to two *falsetickers*, servers that are not reporting the correct time. Depending on your needs, you may want to consider using more.\\n\\nFor this guide, I've selected seven stratum one servers from around the United States to create a stratum two server for my network. When I selected my servers, I took care to only pick servers that are **OpenAccess** and did not require **NotificationMessage**. Be careful when selecting your own servers as many require a NotificationMessage but neglected to change their policy to RestrictedAccess as [specifically requested](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/NotificationMessage) by ntp.org (Grumble, grumble).\\n\\n* [ntp.your.org](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000498)\\n* [time-b.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000280)\\n* [rackety.udel.edu](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000290)\\n* [clock.fmt.he.net](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000011)\\n* [gpstime.la-archdiocese.net](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000787)\\n* [nist1.columbiacountyga.gov](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000378)\\n* [gclock02.dupa01.burst.net](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/PublicTimeServer000974)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nThis guide will work with NTP on CentOS. Other Linux distributions will have slight differences but should not be to difficult to configure using this guide.\\nFirst, install the Network Time Protocol.\\n\\n`yum install ntp -y`\\n\\nYou will likely want NTP to start on boot. CentOS 7 uses SystemD to manage services. Use the following command to enable starting on boot.\\n\\n`systemctl enable ntpd`\\n\\nIf you are running an older version of CentOS you will need to use chkconfig to do this.\\n\\n`chkconfig ntpd on`\\n\\nNow our NTP service will run every time the server boots. At this point we're ready to start configuring the server. We won't start the service yet, we'll wait until we have a basic configuration to test first.\\n\\n## Server Configuration\\n\\nNow that you have selected your upstream servers and have installed NTP on your own server, you are ready to start configuring NTP to synchronize. We will first make a backup of your original NTP configuration file so we can look through it later. For now though we will delete the original (But not the backup!), and then create our own config file to work with.\\n\\n`cp /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp.conf.bak`\\n\\n`rm /etc/ntp.conf`\\n\\n`nano /etc/ntp.conf`\\n\\nIf you want to return to the original file, just replace the actual file with your backup to start over by running the following command.\\n\\n`cp /etc/ntp.conf.bak /etc/ntp.conf`\\n\\nHere is an example ntp.conf file that I'll be using to explain the basic concepts of the configuration.\\n\\n    # Drift file.\\n    driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift\\n    # Permit\\n    restrict default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    restrict -6 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    # Servers\\n    server ntp.your.org iburst\\n    server time-b.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov iburst\\n    server rackety.udel.edu iburst\\n    server clock.fmt.he.net iburst\\n    server gpstime.la-archdiocese.net iburst\\n    server nist1.columbiacountyga.gov iburst\\n    server gclock02.dupa01.burst.net iburst\\n    disable monitor\\n\\nNow lets break down each of these pieces and figure out what they do.\\nFirst, the **drift file**. The drift file stores information about your system clock's drift tendency. Most system clocks keep time reasonably well but still require synchronization in order to remain accurate. The drift file keeps track of how much your system clock tends to drift from actual time. Then, if you lose your connection to your synchronization servers, it can correct itself based on the drift data it has collected. This give you a bit of slack to work with if your connections ever go down.\\n\\nThe **restrict** lines restricts what external machines can do to our server. The **server **lines define the addresses we will attempt to synchronize with. First we declare the server name and then add the **iburst** parameter. The [iburst parameter](http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.1/confopt.htm) has the service send a burst of eight packets instead of only one when the server is unreachable to help speed up the time to acquire a connection.\\n\\nThe **disable monitor** line [fixes a vulnerability](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#DRDoS_Amplification_Attack_using) from January 2014 on older versions of NTP.\\n\\nWe can now save our config file and start the service!\\n\\n`systemctl start ntpd`\\n\\nor\\n\\n`service ntpd start`\\n\\nNow that the NTP service is running, we need to make sure our firewall is configured to allow incoming NTP traffic so our clients can synchronize with our server.\\n\\n`firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ntp`\\n\\n`systemctl restart firewalld`\\n\\nor\\n\\n`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT`\\n\\n`/sbin/service iptables save`\\n\\n`service iptables restart`\\n\\nOnce the server is running we can use the command `ntpq -p` to list our servers and view details about our connections to them. We can also use `ntpstat` to see our current synchronization status. For details on what this data means, check the [NTP documentation page for the ntpq command](http://doc.ntp.org/4.2.4/ntpq.html).\\n\\n## Client Configuration\\n\\nThe client configuration is much simpler than the server configuration was. First, repeat the installation steps for the NTP service. Next, repeat the configuration steps but when you create your new ntp.conf file we will do some things differently.\\n\\n    # Drift file.\\n    driftfile /var/lib/ntp/drift\\n    # Permit\\n    restrict default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    restrict -6 default limited kod nomodify notrap nopeer\\n    # Servers\\n    server time.mydomain.com iburst\\n\\nSince our source is known, and likely internal, we can get away with a bit less security. Also, since we don't need anything to connect to the clients on an incoming port, we don't need to modify our firewall rules as long as outgoing traffic is unrestricted (As it is by default).\\nFinally, use the `ntpq -p` and `ntpstat` commands to verify your NTP service is synchronizing with your server.\\n\\nCongratulations! You have just finished configuring your basic NTP server and clients! There are several more things we could do to improve security and redundancy but this is where this particular guide will end.\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/posts/2014-08-04-NTP_Configuration.md\n// module id = 191\n// module chunks = 2","module.exports = \"Hyper-V can be a particularly useful tool for consolidating computing resources. However, while consolidating machines into VMs can lower your hardware overhead costs, this introduces a single failure point for all your machines. If the Hyper-V server goes down, all your VMs will go down as well.\\n\\nTo overcome this issue, we can use Hyper-V's Failover and Load-balancing tools to build a Hyper-V cluster. These tools will provide failover for our machines so that, in the event of a critical failure on one of our Hyper-V nodes, the VMs running on that node will come back up on another node within seconds.\\n\\n## Install OS\\n\\nBegin by installing Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter on each of your nodes.\\n\\n>If you are not planning on creating more than two Server 2012 Standard virtual machines, you can use Server 2012 Standard edition. However, if you need more Server 2012 Standard instances or if you need Server 2012 Datacenter instances, you will need to use Server 2012 Datacenter for your cluster nodes.\\n\\n> This is because of the way Microsoft handles their server licenses [(More details)](http://www.altaro.com/hyper-v/virtual-machine-licensing-hyper-v/).\\n\\nWe don't need anything fancy here. Just install the OS normally and apply all updates.\\n\\n## Network Overview\\n\\nAt a minimum, we need three separate networks: Data, Heartbeat, and iSCSI. The Data network will handle client connections and Internet connectivity. The Heartbeat network is an internal network exclusive to the cluster used for Live Migrations of virtual machines and cluster communications between nodes. The iSCSI network connects each of our nodes to our remote storage device.\\n\\n>For the purposes of this guide, the remote storage will be located on a [NimbleStorage](http://www.nimblestorage.com/products-technology/products-specs/) SAN. Nimble recommends using Multipath I/O instead of network teaming for their iSCSI connections so that is what this guide will be doing. Check with your remote storage manufacturer and use their recommended best practices.\\n\\n## Configure Network Connections\\n\\nFor this example, each of our cluster nodes has six Network Interface Cards (NICs) to provide redundancy for each network connection. We are going to use the NIC Teaming manager to manage our Load Balancing and Failover (LBFO) for\\nour duplicate NICs.\\n\\n> The NIC Teaming manager can be opened by running *lbfoadmin* from the Start menu or by clicking the link next to NIC Teaming in *Server Manager > Local Server*.\\n\\nLets team our Data and Heartbeat connections. Our iSCSI connections will use Multipath I/O instead. [Instructions NIC teaming can be found here.](/2015/07/06/Load_Balancing_and_Failover_on_Server_2012/)\\n\\n>The six NICs on my servers are in three pairs of two NICs each. To increase redundancy, I split my teams across the pairs so if any one pair were to go down, the other two would be able to handle the traffic until the first pair\\ncould be replaced.\\n\\nNow that our teams have been created, we need to configure the addresses of each connection. The following table shows an example configuration. Note that the Data, Heartbeat, and iSCSI networks are on separate subnets. Modify this as\\nnecessary for your own network environment.\\n\\n|           | NICs | Node1        | Node2        | Node3        | Subnet |\\n|-----------|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|\\n| Data      | 1, 6 | 192.168.0.11 | 192.168.0.12 | 192.168.0.13 | /24    |\\n| Heartbeat | 2, 3 | 192.168.1.11 | 192.168.1.12 | 192.168.1.13 | /24    |\\n| iSCSI     | 4    | 192.168.2.11 | 192.168.2.12 | 192.168.2.13 | /24    |\\n| iSCSI     | 5    | 192.168.2.21 | 192.168.2.22 | 192.168.2.23 | /24    |\\n\\n## Miscellaneous\\n\\nEnable Remote Desktop connections to each of your nodes so we can manage them more easily later. We also need to add each node to our domain. If your remote storage solution uses Multipath I/O, install that now using this [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852172.aspx):\\n\\n`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature –Online –FeatureName MultiPathIO`\\n\\n>If you are using a NimbleStorage SAN, you should install their Nimble Connection utility now. Be sure to select the deselected option when prompted for components to install.\\n\\n>I don't think the nodes _must_ be members of a domain but it does make several steps in the install simpler.\\n\\n## Install Hyper-V\\nTo install the Hyper-V service, run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205467%28v=wps.630%29.aspx) on each node:\\n\\n`Install-WindowsFeature –Name Hyper-V -IncludeManagementTools -Restart`\\n\\n> This command will install the Hyper-V service with its management tools and then restart the server.\\n\\n## Configure Virtual Switch\\n\\nWe need to create our Hyper-V Virtual Switches. For a smooth cluster installation, make sure each of these switches is identical on each node. A way to do this without much hassle is to run the same [PowerShell commands](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848455%28v=wps.630%29.aspx) on each node instead of manually configuring each switch. Run the following command on each node. If you are accessing your node via RDP your connection will be interrupted for a few seconds.\\n\\n`New-VMSwitch “Data” –NetAdapterName “Data” –AllowManagementOS:$true`\\n\\n>This command will create a new virtual switch named Data that is connected to the network adapter on your server node named Data. It will create a new virtual NIC on your node called vData that your local node will use since\\nthe physical NIC is now tied directly to the virtual switch.\\n\\n## Install Failover Clustering\\n\\nWe are nearly ready to cluster our node servers! On each node, run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj205467%28v=wps.630%29.aspx) to install the Failover Clustering service with its management tools:\\n\\n`Install-WindowsFeature –Name Failover-Clustering –IncludeManagementTools`\\n\\nBefore we actually cluster our nodes, let's test our configuration. Run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee461026.aspx) and check the report for any failures.\\n\\n`Test-Cluster –Node Node1,Node2,Node3 -ReportName \\\"C:\\\\TestClusterReport\\\"`\\n\\n>You are likely to get warnings concerning your cluster's storage. This is fine. We will configure the cluster's shared storage soon.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the report and addressing any problems, we are ready to cluster our nodes! Run the following [PowerShell command](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee460973.aspx) to create the cluster:\\n\\n`New-Cluster –Name Cluster1 –Node Node1,Node2,Node3 –StaticAddress 192.168.0.10`\\n\\n## Configure Cluster Shared Volumes\\n\\nAt this point, you should refer to your remote storage manufacturer's best practice documentation for Hyper-V to configure your Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV).\\n\\n>I will describe the steps necessary for a NimbleStorage SAN. If you are using a different remote storage system, you can skip most of this section and refer to your manufacturer's documentation instead.\\n\\n>I will describe the steps necessary to connect to an existing volume but not how to create that volume on the SAN. Please refer to [their documentation](https://infosight.nimblestorage.com/InfoSight/login) instead.\\n\\nOn each node, open the Nimble Connection Manager and exclude all addresses except the iSCSI addresses. Make sure each node's Initiator Name is added to the SAN's initiator group. Enter your Nimble's Discovery IP and switch to the Nimble Volumes tab. Select the desired volume and click connect.\\n\\nOn only one of your nodes, open Disk Management and bring the new disk online. Initialize the disk and format with NTFS. You do not need to select a drive letter. In the Failover Cluster Manager, right click on Disks and select Add Disk. Select the available disks you want to add to the cluster's shared storage and click OK. Finally, under the disks item in the Failover Cluster Manager, right click on the volume(s) you just added and select Add to Cluster Shared Volume.\\n\\n>Your new Cluster Shared Volume is now available on each server at \\\"C:\\\\\\\\clustershared\\\\\\\\Volume01\\\\\\\\\\\".\\n\\n>It is recommended to edit the properties of your Cluster Shared Volumes to change their names from Volume01, Volume02, etc to match the names of the volumes on your SAN.\\n\\n>For detailed information about Cluster Shared Volumes, check out this [MSDN article](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/clustering/archive/2013/12/02/10473247.aspx).\\n\\n## Ready for Roles\\n\\nWe are done installing and configuring our Hyper-V cluster! At this point, we are free to add VMs to the cluster as roles. I may write another article describing what can be done here later.\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/posts/2015-07-04-Configuring_a_Hyper-V_Cluster.md\n// module id = 192\n// module chunks = 2","module.exports = \"[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) has created a series of holiday themed programming exercises over at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) and I thought it would be fun to post my solutions to these exercises now that they have all been released. I'll be posting more of my solutions as I have time to write up my methodologies (and complete some of them).\\n\\nThe first set of puzzles involves Santa navigating an infinite high-rise building with and infinite basement. Santa is given instructions in the form of a string of parentheses which tell him to go up or down one floor.\\n\\n# Part 1\\n\\n## Problem\\n\\n>Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.\\n>\\n>An opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.\\n>\\n>The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.\\n\\n## Methodology\\nBoth of these solutions follow the same basic formula. First, I read in the input that I've saved in `source/day1source.txt` and assign it to a variable. Next, I create a variable to hold the value of the current floor. I then use a loop to loop through each character in the string.

For this puzzle we are given the dimensions of a bunch of presents as a list of strings and are asked to compute how much wrapping paper and ribbon should be ordered to wrap the remaining presents.\\n\\nGet your own puzzle input and record your progress over at [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)!\\n\\n## Problem 1\\n\\n>The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.\\n>\\n>Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect [right rectangular prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid)), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l`. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.\\n>\\n>All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total **square feet of wrapping paper** should they order?\\n\\n## Methodology\\nI handled the solutions for Node and Python slightly differently because of syntatic differences. Despite these slight changes, the general approach is still the same. I will describe my methodology in terms of the Node.js code.\\n\\nFirst, I read in the source from `source/day2source.txt` and `split()` the string on the new line character, `\\\\n`. I assign this output to the variable `source`. This variable is an array with each element of that array containing the string from each line of the original file.\\n\\nNext, I create the variable `total` to store the running total of how much wrapping paper we need.\\n\\nNow that I have my `source` variable and `total` counter, I loop through the array elements of `source`. On each iteration I split the substring in the array element on the character `x`, find the three side sizes, assign them to temporary variables (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`), and then find the smallest of the six sides and store it in the temporary variable `smallest`.\\n\\nFinally, I add up the dimensions using the given formula and add `smallest` as asked. I then add this value to the current value of `total`. After iterating through all the array elements, I print out the final value of `total`.\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Node.js\\n\\n```js\\nvar fs = require('fs')\\n\\nvar source = fs.readFileSync('../source/day2source.txt').toString().split('\\\\n')\\nvar total = 0\\nfor (var i = 0; i < source.length - 1; i++) {\\n  var tempDim = source[i].split('x')\\n  var s1 = Number(tempDim[0]) * Number(tempDim[1])\\n  var s2 = Number(tempDim[2]) * Number(tempDim[1])\\n  var s3 = Number(tempDim[0]) * Number(tempDim[2])\\n\\n  var smallest = 0\\n\\n  if (s1 > s2) {\\n    if (s2 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s2\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    if (s1 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s1\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  total = total + (2 * s1 + 2 * s2 + 2 * s3 + smallest)\\n}\\n\\nconsole.log('The elves need to order ' + total + ' square feet of wrapping paper.')\\n```\\n\\n### Python\\n\\n```python\\nfilename = '../source/day2source.txt'\\n\\nwith open(filename) as f:\\n    source = [line.rstrip('\\\\n') for line in open(filename)]\\n\\ntotal = 0\\n\\nfor line in source:\\n    temp = line.split('x')\\n    s1 = int(temp[0]) * int(temp[1])\\n    s2 = int(temp[2]) * int(temp[1])\\n    s3 = int(temp[0]) * int(temp[2])\\n\\n    if s1 > s2:\\n        if s2 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s2\\n    else:\\n        if s1 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s1\\n    total = total + (2*s1 + 2* s2 + 2*s3 + smallest)\\n\\nprint \\\"The elves need to order\\\", total, \\\"square feet of wrapping paper\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Problem 2\\n>The elves are also running low on ribbon. Ribbon is all the same width, so they only have to worry about the length they need to order, which they would again like to be exact.\\n>\\n>The ribbon required to wrap a present is the shortest distance around its sides, or the smallest perimeter of any one face. Each present also requires a bow made out of ribbon as well; the feet of ribbon required for the perfect bow is equal to the cubic feet of volume of the present. Don't ask how they tie the bow, though; they'll never tell.\\n>\\n>How many total **feet of ribbon** should they order?\\n\\n## Methodology\\nThis time I need to compare the widths of the packages instead of their face areas. I also need to find the two smallest widths rather than just the smallest. Finally, instead of finding surface area, I need to find a length of ribbon using the given formula.\\n\\n## Solutions\\n\\n### Node.js\\n\\n```js\\nvar fs = require('fs')\\n\\nvar source = fs.readFileSync('../source/day2source.txt').toString().split('\\\\n')\\nvar total = 0\\nfor (var i = 0; i < source.length - 1; i++) {\\n  var tempDim = source[i].split('x')\\n  var s1 = Number(tempDim[0])\\n  var s2 = Number(tempDim[1])\\n  var s3 = Number(tempDim[2])\\n\\n  var smallest = 0\\n  var nextSmallest = 0\\n\\n  if (s1 > s2) {\\n    if (s2 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n      nextSmallest = s2\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s2\\n      if (s1 > s3) {\\n        nextSmallest = s3\\n      } else {\\n        nextSmallest = s1\\n      }\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    if (s1 > s3) {\\n      smallest = s3\\n      nextSmallest = s1\\n    } else {\\n      smallest = s1\\n      if (s2 > s3) {\\n        nextSmallest = s3\\n      } else {\\n        nextSmallest = s2\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  total = total + (smallest * 2) + (nextSmallest * 2) + (s1 * s2 * s3)\\n}\\n\\nconsole.log('The elves need to order ' + total + ' feet of ribbon.')\\n```\\n\\n### Python\\n\\n```python\\nfilename = '../source/day2source.txt'\\n\\nwith open(filename) as f:\\n    source = [line.rstrip('\\\\n') for line in open(filename)]\\n\\ntotal = 0\\n\\nfor line in source:\\n    temp = line.split('x')\\n    s1 = int(temp[0])\\n    s2 = int(temp[1])\\n    s3 = int(temp[2])\\n\\n    if s1 > s2:\\n        if s2 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n            nextSmallest = s2\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s2\\n            if s1 > s3:\\n                nextSmallest = s3\\n            else:\\n                nextSmallest = s1\\n    else:\\n        if s1 > s3:\\n            smallest = s3\\n            nextSmallest = s1\\n        else:\\n            smallest = s1\\n            if s2 > s3:\\n                nextSmallest = s3\\n            else:\\n                nextSmallest = s2\\n\\n    total = total + smallest*2 + nextSmallest*2 + s1*s2*s3\\n\\nprint \\\"The elves need to order\\\", total, \\\"square feet of wrapping paper\\\"\\n```\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/posts/2015-12-28-Advent_of_Code.md\n// module id = 194\n// module chunks = 2","module.exports = \"Last fall I had a bit of fun building a calculator app, [cuddly-weasel](/cuddly-weasel/), using only DOM manipulation and CSS. I thought I would take some time here to highlight some of the more interesting things I ran into in the course of this project.\\n\\nThe [Data Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), or DOM, is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The DOM provides a way to store a HTML or XML document in an object-oriented representation that can be manipulated with a scripting language like JavaScript.\\n\\nWhile [DOM manipulation](https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website/topics/jquery-dom-manipulation/jquery-dom) is useful, it generally isn't recommended to do your entire front end with DOM manipulation as it is much simpler to build the outline in HTML or a templating engine like ~~[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)~~ *Edit: Jade has been renamed to [Pug](http://pugjs.org/)* or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) and then modify that existing code. However, it is possible to generate a page using very little markup and building the page with DOM manipulation and this is exactly what I did for this project.\\n\\n# Cuddly Weasel\\n\\nThe complete [app is available here](/cuddly-weasel/) and the [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/keawade/cuddly-weasel). The rest of this article will highlight some of the more interesting implementations and manipulations in the application.\\n\\n## Name\\n\\nThis project was one of the first projects that I used GitHub's built in project name generator for. I knew what I was building but didn't care for the dull name of just \\\"Calculator\\\" so I cycled through several names until settling upon `cuddly-weasel`. If I were building this app for anything other than my own personal use and practice, I would probably need to put in more effort. As it stands, though, I just need a unique name for my project and this one is a fun one.\\n\\n[![Rendered app](http://image.thum.io/get/width/800/crop/700/http://keawade.io/cuddly-weasel)](/cuddly-weasel/)\\n\\n## Design Considerations\\n\\nLike the name, the visual design for this project is arbitrary. I didn't have any real goal in mind with this design, I just built some elements and then started throwing CSS at it to see what stuck.\\n\\n### Colors and Font\\n\\nI went with the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette for simplicity. It allowed me to have a solid palette without having to make it up as I worked. The theme toggle was built for fun since Solarized already had a light theme with colors that directly correspond to each other. All I needed was an alternate set of colors in the CSS and it was done.\\n\\nFor the font I used [Inconsolata](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata) from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). I chose this font was because I wanted a monospace font and I also wanted to make sure that all users would see the same font and have the same experience.\\n\\n### Layout\\n\\nOriginally, I only had the top four rows of buttons with the core mechanics for the calculator which mirrored simple calculators one might find at a Walmart. As I kept adding more buttons, I never made any big changes to the design and just let [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) continue my original layout with the new buttons.\\n\\n## Code\\n\\nMy app is an interface that uses the [mathjs](http://mathjs.org/) library to do all the actual calculations. This means that users can use mathjs features that I haven't implemented buttons for by manually typing the [expressions](http://mathjs.org/docs/index.html) into the input box.\\n\\n### Buttons\\n\\nEach button element has an event listener listening for a click event. When that event occurs, it calls the `handleButton(event)` function.\\n\\n```js\\nfunction handleButton(event) {\\n  var box = document.getElementById('cal-box');\\n\\n  if (!(box === document.activeElement)) {\\n    // Solve\\n    if(autoclear){\\n      if(lastNum == '=') {\\n        box.value = '';\\n      }\\n    }\\n    if (event.target.id == '=') {\\n      var temp = box.value.replace(/ln\\\\(/g, 'log(');\\n      answer = math.eval(temp);\\n      if (!isNaN(answer)) {\\n        box.value = answer;\\n        if(autoclear){\\n          lastNum = '=';\\n        } else {\\n          lastNum = answer;\\n        }\\n      }\\n    // Clear\\n    } else if (event.target.id == 'clr') {\\n      box.value = '';\\n      lastNum = 'new';\\n    // Backspace\\n    } else if (event.target.id == '<-') {\\n      box.value = box.value.substring(0, box.value.length - 1);\\n      lastNum = box.value.charAt(box.value.length - 1);\\n    // Numbers\\n    } else if (/[0-9]/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      box.value = box.value + event.target.id;\\n      lastNum = event.target.id;\\n    // Symbols\\n    } else if (/[-/*+.]/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      if(!(/new|[-/*+.]/.test(lastNum))){\\n        box.value = box.value + event.target.id;\\n        lastNum = event.target.id;\\n      }\\n    } else if (event.target.id == '^'){\\n      if (/[0-9]|\\\\)/.test(lastNum)) {\\n        box.value = box.value + '^(';\\n      }\\n    } else if (/[\\\\(\\\\)]/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      box.value = box.value + event.target.id;\\n      lastNum = event.target.id;\\n    // Trig Functions\\n    } else if (/sin|cos|tan|cot|sqrt|e\\\\^|ln/.test(event.target.id)) {\\n      box.value = box.value + event.target.id + '('\\n      lastNum = '(';\\n    } else if (/pi/.test(event.target.id)){\\n      box.value = box.value + '(pi)';\\n      lastNum = ')';\\n    }\\n    this.blur();\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, my code uses a line of else-if statements combined with some simple [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to quickly run through the potential inputs from the button's click event.\\n\\nThe code also keeps track of what the last character was to determine whether or not the current key press is valid. For example, if the partial expression `1+1-` has been entered, the app will not allow a key press event to enter an operator since the last character was also an operator.\\n\\nAt the end of the list of possible inputs, I've called `this.blur()` to remove focus on the clicked element caused by the default click event. This way, if the user presses their return key, it won't just trigger this click again but will only trigger the keypress event as it is supposed too.\\n\\n### Keyboard Input\\n\\nThe keyboard input was interesting. I started by implementing an event listener to listen for keypress events and evaluate them.\\n\\n```js\\ndocument.addEventListener('keypress', function(key) {\\n  var keyString = String.fromCharCode(key.charCode);\\n  if (key.keyCode == 13) {\\n    document.getElementById('=').click();\\n  } else if (/[0-9]|[-/*+=.^()]/.test(keyString)) {\\n    document.getElementById(keyString).click();\\n  } else if (key.keyCode == 8) {\\n    var box = document.getElementById('cal-box')\\n    if (box === document.activeElement) {\\n      //\\n    } else {\\n      if (box.value == '') {\\n        // Do nothing\\n      } else {\\n        document.getElementById('<-').click();\\n      }\\n    }\\n  } // keyCode 46 is Delete\\n}, false);\\n```\\n\\nHere, the listener waits for a keypress and then does a quick set of evaluations. First, it checks if the keypress is a \\n\\n[Keypress event details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keypress)\\n\\nFunctions, functions, functions.\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/posts/2016-01-21-cuddly-weasel.md\n// module id = 195\n// module chunks = 2","module.exports = \"**Update:** I have recently rebuilt this app without Redux or PokeAPI.
